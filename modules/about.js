                <h2>ðŸ’Ž FUEL THE REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <p>It all began with a passion for DJing, gradually accumulating new skills, knowledge, and life experiences along the way.</p>
                
<p> DJ Perch has been digging in the crates and spinning vinyl since way back in 2005. His weapon of choice? A killer mix of funk, disco, soul, hip-hop, and trippy experimental electronics.<p/>
<p>In 2022, he caught a serious analog synth fever. Now, he's a complete Terminator on the decks, mixing raw turntablism techniques, with deep, modular soundscapes. Don't sleep on this.<p/>

                <p>Today, my work represents the culmination of my journeyâ€”everything I've absorbed, processed, and mixed with my own hands and mind.</p>
                
                <p>Constantly revolutionizing approaches and perspectives through sound and performance.</p>
